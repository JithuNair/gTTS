# gTTS
A sample code to convert a pdf to mp3 using google text to speech service which is opensource!

# Novel
The novel is listed as Open-Source and freely downloable from websites online in the pdf format. The purpose of this project is to convert the PDF into a MP3 format so that it can be heard without hassles.
If there are any copyright violations I can remove the PDF instantly, the material uploaded IS NOT being used for any monetary gains and hence does not directly violate any immediate copyright laws either.

# Engine
The code uses Google Text-to-Speech engine and has trouble with some common words like "it" which it reads as "I....T" as time progresses and I get more familiar with the library I will try and implement pauses for punctuations and try to see if we can use alternates for commonly uses conjunctions in the English Grammar.

# Purpose
This piece of code is just a simple exercise to hone my skills in Python and to explore the various things I can do with the language.
